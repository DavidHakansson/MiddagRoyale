2024-04-19T08:57:36.468Z [INFO]: # Switching to commit: 714fb85cbe8284da50ca360a2386ef77b4ec7169
2024-04-19T08:57:36.513Z [INFO]: Note: switching to '714fb85cbe8284da50ca360a2386ef77b4ec7169'.
                                 You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
                                 changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
                                 state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
                                 If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
                                 do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
                                 git switch -c <new-branch-name>
                                 Or undo this operation with:
                                 git switch -
                                 Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
                                 HEAD is now at 714fb85 Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/dev' into dev
